After submitting the designs for manufacturing, I've received a email from JLCPCB, saying my boards were flagged during review:

Support:
> [...] Sorry to bother you, but there is an issue that we want to confirm with you before proceeding.
> As shown below, for these boards covered with many pads, they should be made with ENIG according to company process.
> Shall we send you the supplement link for ENIG?

Client:
> [...] What's the specific requirement for such boards? [...]

Support:
> [...] Since the boards are covered with pads, if it is made with HASL, the board may be short circuit or other problems. [...]

Client:
> I understand the short-circuit issue! I've had such boards manufactured before, including by JLCPCB. I don't mind manually removing short-circuits - short-circuits will not be a problem. These are prototyping surfaces, after all. I'd like to get these manufactured with HASL, and I will not raise any complains if I get short-circuits on these boards. I do not expect you to remove the short-circuits before shipping.

Support:
> Well noted with many thanks.
> We will continue to proceed your orders with HASL.
> If scrap or short circuit occurs, we will not accept complaints.
